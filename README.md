This is the back end server for Project 5 of the Junior Web Developer path.

### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation ###

Steps:
1. Clone this repo.

2. Open the terminal from within the project folder and run the command npm install.
You should now have all the dependencies installed (+ node_modules folder)

3. Launch the server with the command node server.
The server should now be running on localhost with default port 3000.
If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. Listening on port 3001.

4. Open the index.html file with Live Server or the way you prefer.

ðŸš€ You should now see and use the project! Enjoy!
